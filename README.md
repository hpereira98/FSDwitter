# FSDwitter - Messaging Service
Persistent and Ordered Messaging System made for Foundations of Distributed Systems class.

This project was implemented using Java and Atomix, thus practicing event-oriented programming.

This project was carried out in the first semester of the fourth year of informatics engineering course at University of Minho. [2019-2020]

Informally, the system can be described as similar to Twitter with some extra correction requirements.
